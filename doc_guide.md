Documentation Guide
==================
Last updated: July 2018

Welcome to this documentation guide, it is here to make some important points about how documentation should be organized. This is a test sentence because I don't know how markdown works. I AM ONLY PUTTING IN MARKDOWN FOR NOW

## We can make sub-headings like this
with TWO octothorpes/pound signs/hashtags
This is what it looks like when I add text under a heading 
	what happens when we indent?

Here's an example of a list:
*we start these out with asterisks (*)
* do not leave a space between the asterisk and what you are writing

# We can make headings with one octothorpe/pound sign/hashtag
```
monospace means we can add code into our markdown file
		indent
		will this work without actual code?
		print("possibly")
```
